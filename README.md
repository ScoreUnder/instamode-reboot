InstaMode Reboot
================

A fork of InstaMode by Kaikz.

Provides players with a simple way of switching mode on the go, without
allowing them to switch others' game mode.

In-Game Usage
-------------

The /mode command takes one argument, the mode to switch to. You can even
specify the first few letters of a mode and it will still work.

```
/mode c
/mode surv
/mode sp
```
